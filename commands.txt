Based on the project requirements and your current implementation, here's what you still need to add to make your evaluation toolkit complete:

Missing Data Generator:


You have Uniform and Skewed but are missing the Correlated Attributes generator, where certain attributes co-occur frequently


Query Workload Variations:


Your current evaluation only uses random queries
Need to add different query patterns (e.g. queries targeting specific regions/clusters)
Consider varying k values in k-NN searches


Metrics Expansion:


Add memory usage tracking
Include index size measurements
Add throughput metrics (queries per second)
Consider adding index construction parameters impact


Filter Specificity Analysis:


Add analysis of filter combinations (e.g. multiple attributes)
Include varying filter selectivity ranges
Consider dynamic filter changes impact


Attribute Distribution Analysis:


Add visualization of attribute distributions
Include statistical measures of distribution characteristics
Compare distribution impact on performance


Query Result Analysis:


Add quality metrics beyond just recall (e.g. precision, F1-score)
Include distance distribution analysis of results
Add analysis of false positives/negatives in filtered results


Comparative Analysis:


Add cross-comparison between different distribution types
Include performance degradation analysis under different loads
Add scalability analysis with increasing dataset size

The key is to expand beyond just specificity comparisons to get a complete picture of the index's behavior under different conditions. This will help provide comprehensive recommendations for improving filtered ANN indices.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or suggest specific metrics implementations?


A cluster quality metric (e.g., silhouette score)
Distance distribution analysis between points with same/different labels
Precision metrics in addition to recall

Alternative approaches for negative correlation could be:


Use feature transformations before indexing
Place points with same labels in opposite regions of space
But this might reduce HNSW's efficiency since it's optimized for finding nearby points
